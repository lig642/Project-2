        Fujian Tulou is a kind of giant enclosed building in Fujian Province, which uses unprocessed raw earth as a load-bearing wall and looks like it encloses the open interior, so the word "enclosed" or "earth" is used to describe this kind of building.
Its function is to house four generations in one house and to unite residence and defense, with a total of about 3,000 buildings, mainly located in Yongding District of Longyan City and Nanjing, Zhao'an, Pinghe and Hua'an counties of Zhangzhou City in Fujian Province, China. Fujian Tulou is the characteristic dwelling of Chinese in Southeast China and Southeast Asia, which originated in the late Tang and early Song dynasties and developed into the present layout in the late Ming dynasty, with the number increasing significantly in the Republic of China. Tulou is a compound for the whole family of Han Chinese immigrants from North China and Central China who moved to the South to escape from war, and because of their own security concerns, they strengthened the defensive function of the building. Since dynastic changes always occur periodically in China, this type of building, which is suitable for defense, was invented and quickly spread throughout Fujian and became a part of local residents' lives.
The Fujian Tulou is considered to be one of the major categories of residential buildings in China because of its convenience of being located on the mountain, taking materials from the local area, and encompassing the whole clan.

        Until the 1970s, the term "Hakka pavilions" was commonly used in China, and the most famous pavilions, such as Zhenchenglou, Chengqilou, and Tianluokeng, were all inhabited by Hakka people, leading to the misconception that this building was a unique form of Hakka architecture. Subsequent research in mainland China found that Minnan people also lived in Fujian pailou in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, so it was realized that the prefix "Hakka" was not comprehensive enough for the pailou. The term "Weilong House" is used to refer to the Hakka kind of architecture, which is more narrow in scope. 

        In Malaysia and Indonesia, the term "wei-lou" is more often used, as the word "earth" has a derogatory meaning in Chinese culture, and is less commonly referred to as a "tulou".
