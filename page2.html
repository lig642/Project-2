The basic feature of Siheyuan is that the houses and courtyards are symmetrically arranged according to the north-south axis, facing south, with the gate generally opening at the southeast corner and a shadow wall built inside the gate so that outsiders cannot see the activities inside the courtyard. The main house is located on the central axis, flanked by the ear rooms and the left and right rooms. The main room is the living room of the elders, while the compartments are for the younger generation to live in. This solemn layout also reflects the traditional character of the orthodox and strict people of northern China.
